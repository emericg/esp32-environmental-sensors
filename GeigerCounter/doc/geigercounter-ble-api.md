## About the ESP32 Geiger Counter

* This [Geiger Counter](https://emeric.io/EnvironmentalSensors/#geigercounter) is meant to keep you alive by monitoring ambient radiation levels
* It has a Geiger MÃ¼ller tube, used for the detection of ionizing radiation
* Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and has a limited range

## Features

* Read real-time sensor values
* Features can be extended through available GPIO and an open firmware

## Protocol

The device uses BLE GATT for communication.  
Sensor values are immediately available for reading, through standard read/notify characteristics.  

### BLE & GATT

The basic technologies behind the sensors communication are [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) and [GATT](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt).
They allow the devices and the app to share data in a defined manner and define the way you can discover the devices and their services.
In general you have to know about services and characteristics to talk to a BLE device.

### Data structure

The data is encoded in little-endian byte order.  
This means that the data is represented with the least significant byte first.

To understand multi-byte integer representation, you can read the [endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) Wikipedia page.

## Services, characteristics and handles

### Real-time data

A read request will return 16 bytes of data, for example `0x00`.  
You can subscribe to this handle and and receive notifications for new values (once per second) by writing 2 bytes (`0x0100`) to the Client Characteristic Configuration descriptor (`0x2902`).
